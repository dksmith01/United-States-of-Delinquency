This project builds on the work of [Shawn
Allen](http://secularproducts.com/work/), whose [USA
topogram](https://github.com/shawnbot/topogram) is a reference project for many
internet cartographers.

This is a JavaScript implementation of an [algoritm to construct continuous area
cartograms](http://lambert.nico.free.fr/tp/biblio/Dougeniketal1985.pdf), by
James A. Dougenik, Nicholas R. Chrisman and Duane R. Niemeyer, Â©1985 by the
Association of American Geographers. It relies heavily on the work of [Mike
Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/), including
[d3](http://github.com/mbostock/d3) for rendering and
[TopoJSON](http://github.com/mbostock/topojson) for both writing and reading
topological JSON geodata.

The [included
example](https://github.com/shawnbot/d3-cartogram/blob/master/index.html)
combines TopoJSON-encoded and boundaries of the United States from [Natural
Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/) with
[2011 US Census population
estimates](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2011/) to size each
state proportionally.
